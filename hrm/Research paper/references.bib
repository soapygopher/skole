I can be pretty confident that a 100 KLOC system is bigger than a 10KLOC system. But if I've written the 100KLOC system in a year, and Joe writes the same system in 10KLOC during the same time, that doesn't make me more productive. Indeed I would conclude that our productivities are about the same but my system is much more poorly designed. - http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." - Abelson & Sussman

Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling -- the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. - Niklaus Wirth
