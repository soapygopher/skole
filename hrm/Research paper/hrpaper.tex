introduction

	summary

	why i chose this problem

	solfrid

main part

	software engineering in general

		process

			planning, coding, compliling, debugging, maintenance

		difficulty of assessing product quality

		on complexity

			maintenance cost

			increasing scope of projects since the start of programming

			now often maintenance of existing systems instead of starting from scratch

		indivudal productivity as part of tqm

	alternatives

		number of code lines

			often irrelevant: python and c examples

		features added

		bugs fixed

		code quality

			quotes galore

			arguably a subjective measure, hard to formalize

		advanced metrics

			http://www.examiner.com/article/article-9-how-to-measure-programmer-productivity

			cyclomatic

		time spent

		(wtfs per minute)

	external conditions

		available hardware

		two displays instead of one

		ssd

		project scope

			changing specs

	discussion

		how to tie this to the individual employee

	practice

		practice in steria

conclusion

	problem is difficult: no panacea

	summarize practices

``Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.'' - Abelson and Sussman

Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling -- the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. - Niklaus Wirth

http://hostilefork.com/2012/12/01/software-engineering-quotes/

I can be pretty confident that a 100 KLOC system is bigger than a 10KLOC system. But if I've written the 100KLOC system in a year, and Joe writes the same system in 10KLOC during the same time, that doesn't make me more productive. Indeed I would conclude that our productivities are about the same but my system is much more poorly designed. - http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html
