introduction
	summary
	why i chose this problem
	solfrid
main part
	software engineering in general
		process
			planning, coding, compliling, debugging, maintenance
		difficulty of assessing product quality
		on complexity
			maintenance cost
			increasing scope of projects since the start of programming
			now often maintenance of existing systems instead of starting from scratch
		indivudal productivity as part of tqm
	alternatives
		number of code lines
			often irrelevant: python and c examples
		features added
		bugs fixed
		code quality
			quotes galore
			arguably a subjective measure, hard to formalize
		advanced metrics

		time spent
		(wtfs per minute)
	external conditions
		available hardware
		two displays instead of one

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." - Abelson & Sussman
Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling -- the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. - Niklaus Wirth

I can be pretty confident that a 100 KLOC system is bigger than a 10KLOC system. But if I've written the 100KLOC system in a year, and Joe writes the same system in 10KLOC during the same time, that doesn't make me more productive. Indeed I would conclude that our productivities are about the same but my system is much more poorly designed. - http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html
