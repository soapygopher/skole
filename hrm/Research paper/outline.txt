	why i chose this problem
	solfrid
main part
	software engineering in general
		process
			planning, coding, compliling, debugging, maintenance
		difficulty of assessing product quality
		on complexity
			maintenance cost
			increasing scope of projects since the start of programming
			now often maintenance of existing systems instead of starting from scratch
		indivudal productivity as part of tqm
	alternatives
		number of code lines
			often irrelevant: python and c examples
		features added
		bugs fixed
		code quality
			quotes galore
			arguably a subjective measure, hard to formalize
		advanced metrics
			
		time spent
		(wtfs per minute)
	external conditions
		available hardware
		two displays instead of one
			
			
		project scope
			changing specs
	discussion
		how to tie this to the individual employee
	practice
		practice in steria
conclusion
	problem is difficult: no panacea
	summarize practices
